# DiscreteDynamics
Code surrounding questions of orbits, itineraries, and rotation numbers of the unit disc
This class can help generate large data sets regarding orbits about the unit disc. This information can then be used to support research within discrete dynamics.
I hope to see this code be used to find the connectivity of the Julia set for z^3+c and eventually z^n+c.
